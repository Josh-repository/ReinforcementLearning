# 2048-with-Deep -RL
The implementation requires tensorflow. The algorithm for trainning ran for 35,000 epochs. The weights and bias tuned using back propogation are stored into a CSV file inside Final_Weights folder, which can be used to play 2048. But, the trained hyperparameter values are not optimal and 
the maximum tile scored obtained was 64. The trainning was done with CPU RAM memory of 16 Gb and took 10 hrs to complete 35,000 epochs. If others have better graphical configuration, can aim for higher epochs which will result in better score and tile value.  

To start trainning:
1. Navigate to gamecode folder.
2. Run code python 2048_DRL.py
