Task Done so far:
    1. Gone through Initial overview of How 2048 game functions. 
    2. Understanding in deep how the environment chnages and the role of Q-learning to solve such uncertain/ dynamicaly changing environment.
    3. Gone through the works implemented in our team regarding Q-learning and noted down the drwabacks
        3.a. Calculating and storing actions for each state in 2048 games requires countless memory and time.
        3.b. This drawback makes the performance of our model worse.     
    3. To overcome such drawback, done some literature review and gone through works related to deep learning associated with supervised and unsupervised approach.
    4. Later planned to implement Deep Reinforcement learning[Convolution Neural Network and Fully Connected layers] 
    5. Analyzed the '2048' game built by our team and made some changes in it as per deep Q-learning model.
    6. Succesfully implemented a agent that learns the environment of 2048.
    7. The results obtained are documented and conclusion were made.

Task to do:
    1. Nil.
